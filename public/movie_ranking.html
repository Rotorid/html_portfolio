<h1>The best movies according to Rayan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Batman</h3>
<p>One of my favourite movies, I love the dark vibe</p>
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>
  Now I have become death, the destroyer of worlds. Crazy cinematography by
  Nolan, absolutely loved it
</p>
<h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>
<p>
  Both infinity war and endgame were top notch but infinty war opened so many
  dimensions to MCU
